Satisfy the equation
Given an array A[ ] of N of  integers, find the index of values that satisfy A + B = C + D where A,B,C & D are integers values in the array.
Note: As there may be multiple pairs satisfying the equation return lexicographically smallest order of  A, B, C and D and return all as -1 if there are no pairs satisfying the equation.
Input:
N = 7
A[] = {3, 4, 7, 1, 2, 9, 8}
Output:
0 2 3 5
Explanation:
A[0] + A[2] = 3+7 = 10
A[3] + A[5] = 1+9 = 10
